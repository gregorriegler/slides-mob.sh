# Wiio's Law

Communication usually fails, except by accident.

-- <cite>Osmo Antero Wiio</cite>

---

## Communication

- If it can fail, it will.
- If it cannot fail, it still most usually fails.
- If it seems to succeed in the intended way, there's a misunderstanding.
- If you are content with your message, it certainly fails.

---

### If a message can be interpreted in several ways, it will be interpreted in a manner that maximizes the damage.

## Mob Programming
aka **Ensemble Programming**,

or **Advanced Software Teaming**

---

Mob Programming is all about working well together as a team.

###  Actually together. 

---

### A meeting where the minutes are code

- in the same space 
- at the same time 
- on the same code 
- on the same screen 
- solving the same problem.

- We learn from each other.
- We enjoy ourselves.
- We identify and correct mistakes early.
