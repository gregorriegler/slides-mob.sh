# Wiio's Law

### If a message can be interpreted in several ways, it will be interpreted in a manner that maximizes the damage.

## Mob Programming
aka **Ensemble Programming**,

or **Advanced Software Teaming**

---

Mob Programming is all about working well together as a team.

###  Actually together. 

---

### A meeting where the minutes are code

- in the same space 
- at the same time 
- on the same code 
- on the same screen 
- solving the same problem

---

### A deliberate practice

- Strong style (dedicated typist/talker)
- Rotate frequently
- Safe space
- Regular retrospectives
- Continuous improvement

---

### Benefits

- We learn from each other.
- We enjoy ourselves.
- We identify and correct mistakes early.
